# Game Page

The game page lets you play a game where you need to guess a predetermined Fusion monster using the cardinfo endpoint of the YGOPRODECK API with queries from the filter.
You use the search bar to search for monsters and use the results of the guess to figure out what the monster is.
If the background of the value is green, it is correct, red means it is wrong, purple means it is higher than the predetermined card and purple-blue means that it is lower than the predetermined card.
A modal pops up, congratulating you, when you guess the correct monster and you can reset the game.
You can also use the filter to help you to narrow down the guesses such as only filtering for machine monsters if your previous guess of machine type was correct.
You can also show the card images of all the search results to help you guess as well.
